#### "Origin-al Sin"
Three of the most influential figures in formally describing space -- Euclid, Galileo, and Einstein -- all agreed on one fundamental aspect in their descriptions: space is seemingly homogeneous with no preferred points (sorry Newton).

This should naturally lead anyone who has taken an undergraduate math course to question why vector spaces, which possess a distinct origin, are the default algebraic setting for most applications of geometry.

This question has a rather simple answer: rather than points in space belonging to a vector space, they belong to a larger structure called an **affine space** in which displacements between points are defined using vectors. Every affine space possesses an associated vector space of displacements, and this vector space uniquely characterizes the affine space *up to isomorphism*.

The ability to identify an affine space with its associated vector space is exactly why most courses neglect any mention of affine spaces. Working with the displacement vectors between points rather than the points themselves skips a lot of formalism that an engineering student might never have been exposed to and possibly never will be exposed to.

This would be fine if it weren't for the fact that treating points like vectors leads to questions like "what is the sum of London and Paris?"  The answer to this question is entirely dependent on your choice of origin, and is almost certainly more confusing than useful. This is why affine space frameworks are used in places such as computer graphics, to avoid even allowing these questions in the first place.


If after reading all of this, you suddenly feel an intense urge to learn more about affine spaces and the most famous type of affine space, Euclidian space, then you should keep an eye out for the next article which will fully cover *what* an affine space is in full gory detail and give in depth examples of affine spaces and the kinds of things that can be done with them.
